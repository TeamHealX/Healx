## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeamHealX/Healx.git
cd Healx
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.

Enable Authentication with Email/Password sign-in method.

Enable Cloud Firestore in test mode (for development).

Add a new Web app to your Firebase project and copy the Firebase config.

Create src/firebase.js and add the following code:

// src/firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);

### 4. Set up environment variables for encryption key
Create a .env file in the project root (do not commit this file):

REACT_APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_super_secret_key_here

### 5. Run the app
```bash
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 🛡 Security Notes
All health records are encrypted using AES encryption via CryptoJS before uploading.

The app currently uses a static encryption key stored in the .env file for MVP purposes:

Encryption keys must be stored securely using environment variables (.env) and never committed to source control.

This is a temporary solution. For production, this will be replaced with per-user encryption keys.

Firestore security rules should be configured to restrict data access only to authorized users.


---

## 🔄 Later Improvements (Post-MVP)
To ensure privacy and scalability in a production environment, the following upgrades are planned:

🔐 Per-user Encryption Keys
Each user will have a unique encryption key, derived or securely stored, so that only they (and authorized share recipients) can decrypt their files.

🔑 Key Derivation or Secure Key Management
Implement key derivation (e.g., using user password + salt with PBKDF2 or Argon2) or integrate a secure key vault to protect keys.

🔏 Zero-Knowledge Access
Move towards a zero-knowledge architecture where even the backend cannot decrypt user records.
